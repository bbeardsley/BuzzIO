I've had the same problem with the buzzers not binding. It happens every time.
 

The solution I use is:
 

Start Buzz - you will get a message that buzzers have not been detected.
Insert USB dongle into USB port on PS3.
Hold bind button down on side of dongle until it flashes blue.
Now push the power button on the buzzer forwards - I find I have to do this 2-3 times and then the buzzer will flash. It should flash 12 times (8 slow followed by 4 quick) If it only flashes 8 times continue until you get 12. Lock the buzzer power switch by pulling it back.
Next push the bind button down and the blue light will go out.
The buzzer(s) should now be ready to use.
